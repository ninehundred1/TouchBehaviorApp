# Autonomous training App on a Raspberry Pie & Touch Screen setup

##### This App is set to be ran on the Raspberry Pie using a touchscreen as interface. It uses Kivy as the app development framework in combination with Python.
#

Planned:
- 
* Several different training paradigms can be generated and used for training, ranging from matching images to a cue image, finding shapes in noisy background or completing contours and shapes.

* Real time statistic and data analyis will be performed and can be displayed on request, based on what the paradigm automatically adjusts.

* The Raspberry will feature a water valve to dispense water following correct choices.

* The whole unit is small enough to fit in the cages of small animals



##### So far the basic design is ready and now the paradigms and data analysis is to be implemented
